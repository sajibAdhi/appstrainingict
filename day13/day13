A1. State is a Information;

Q2. Type of States?
A. 

    1)Ephemeral state (sometimes called UI state or local state)
    is the state you can neatly contain in a single widget.

    2) State that is not ephemeral, that you want to share across many 
    parts of your app, and that you want to keep between user sessions, 
    is what we call application state (sometimes also called shared state).
